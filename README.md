## Commentary on business model, licensing, monetisation and related topics

This software is commercially motivated. In other words, the hope is that it will become first: financially self-sustainable, and then second: profitable.

It started out as a side project during the Coronavirus/COVID-19 pandemic of 2020. I wrote it because it was something I could use. However, it soon grew into something quite substantial and I wondered whether there might be a market for it. In other words, would other people want to use it, but also, be willing to pay money for it? Because if so, then I could continue working on it and turn it into something (hopefully) great. Only one way to find out.

So, currently, this is a side project ... that's trying to be a real commercial project. If it doesn't become real, then that's fine. I'll just write the features I need, and then move on to do other things. However, if I can get revenue and/or sponsorship for it, then I can continue to spend time on it, improve it, and see where it takes us.

With that historical background, here's the plan:

The business model is going to be 'open core'. The entry-level/core edition of NanoBooks will be free and open source. Advanced features or add-ons will be in a premium edition and be paid-for. Note that THE PREMIUM EDITION IS NOT OPEN SOURCE.

The entry-level and premium editions are called NanoBooks CE (community edition) and NanoBooks PE (premium edition) respectively.

For now, here are the planned monetisation tiers (names are temporary and unofficial):

* Level 0 - Free - Access to NanoBooks CE repository and source code. Compile it yourself. Community supported.
* Level 1 - Purchase the NanoBooks PE binary through an app store for $N (unsure what N is yet).
* Level 2 - Subscription - Access to NanoBooks PE repository, source code, issues queue etc. Access to NanoBooks PE binary. Vendor support.

Note that this is only a plan and comes with some caveats.

* This plan could change as new insights come to light. It will probably change. The question is not 'whether' but 'by how much'.
* NanoBooks CE hasn't been completed yet. It's just alpna/beta software at the moment.
* Hence, level 1 does not yet exist.
* For now, level 2 will be implemented via github sponsors. It will be a subscription/recurring thing. Although NanoBooks PE also does not yet exist, a repository will be created and sponsors can submit (ie. via the NanoBooks PE issue queue) feedback and feature requests.

How will I decide what features go into CE and what features are restricted to PE? I don't know yet. There's too many unknowns to be able to say but I will try to strike a balance. 

In general, as more and more features go into PE, simpler or older features will 'trickle down' from PE to CE.
