# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Contribution to any edition of NanoBooks requires accepting, and agreeing to, a Contributor License Agreement(CLA).

To indicate your acceptance and agreement of the [CLA](docs/legal/individual_contributor_license_agreement.md), please submit a Merge Request which adds you to the list of [CLA signatories](docs/legal/individual_contributor_license_agreement_signatories.md). This only needs to be done once per contributor.

It is suggested that the indication of acceptance and agreement can be incorporated into the first Merge Request that you submit.
